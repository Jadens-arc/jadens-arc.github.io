Recently, I've been playing The Sims a lot. Outside of Minecraft I'm not much of a gamer but this game has really gripped me. The last time I played a Sims game I was in elementary school and it was on my 3DS. For some reason I find myself enjoying it much more now than I ever did. There's probably some depressing observation about the burden of adulthood and escapism of fantasy to be had but I'm not that philosophical. Big shout out to [CaryandConnieGaming](https://www.youtube.com/@carynandconniegaming) for appearing in my YouTube recommendations and catalyzing my latest hyperfixation. 

I made a one-to-one replica of my condo in the game. I'm really proud of it. You'll have to take my word for it though because I don't want to post the exact floor plan of my home.
