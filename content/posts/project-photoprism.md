For the past two years I've been doing photography as a hobby. I have an amazing Canon M200 that I love taking pictures on. Not only does it take beautiful, vibrant, 24 megapixel photos but it also captures all that information almost completely uncompressed using Canon's raw format. The only downside is that it generates so much data and requires so much storage. The issue of storage has been ongoing. It started off with me using Google Photos, then they changed their pricing model to not offer free unlimited storage. Then I put everything on a one terabyte Samsung T7 SSD (yes I know about the read/write limitations of SSDs). Then I got a Western Digital MyCloud and the hard drive crashed (thank god for that SSD). Unfortunately I still lost some photos and Western Digital discontinued the product a few months later. So I've been in this purgatory. I have a lot of old pictures in Google Photos and a lot of new ones on my SSD. Neither places seem particularly stable so I've started working on something that will hopefully be better.


## Photoprism
The decentralized, open sourced, solution. With my Raspberry Pi 3B+ and A Seagate 4TB hard drive I've set out on solving this problem myself. 

So far, things have been going well. I used my PC to move all of the photos from my SSD onto the hard drive and then I used Google Takeout to pull all of my photos from Google Photos. Currently my Raspberry Pi is in the process of indexing all of my photos. The setup process was pretty easy too. I used BalenaEtcher to flash a copy of [PhotoPrismPi](https://docs.photoprism.app/getting-started/raspberry-pi/microsd-image/) onto the SD card and it booted right up. The SSL certs for the web interface were a little strange. Initially my web browser wouldn't allow me to access the web interface due to an invalid SSL key. But when I tried to access it the next day it worked just fine. It likely just had to regenerate those certs. Other than that it's been a smooth process.

I'm not going to lie using it can be pretty slow but Photoprism recommends using a Raspberry Pi 4 and up for that exact reason. Currently, it's been running for a little over two days now and has indexed 2,444 raw images. Which is extremely impressive. Unfortunately that's only a fourth of the photos from my camera and none of the photos from Google Photos so I expect this process will likely take at least a week to complete.

I'll keep you guys updated with how things are going :)
