Software developer, occasional writer, and dedicated Neovim user based
in beautiful Las Vegas, Nevada ☀️🌵

## Overview

I've been working at ISP.Net/LV.Net for over two years now as a Full
Stack Developer. I primarily work in PHP with the Symfony framework.
Working at an internet service provider has given me the unique
opportunity to not only grow as a developer building enterprise
software but to also learn about how some of the most critical
infrastructure is managed.

Outside of that, programming has been my passion for a big part of my
life. I taught myself my first programming language at 13 and
instantly became addicted. There hasn't been a single day since where
I haven't worked on a project.

Feel free to check out some of my projects or read my blog, and thanks
for being here at all :)
